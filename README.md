# PianoVideoCreator

unity project that allows you to make those videos on youtube with scrolling piano notes

# structure 
currently the project is chaos and everything is setup for my own setup, if you want to use this please wait till i make it better or get in contact with me to make it better

# Badapple
project also contains some files i used to make a badapple video


# Used resources 
the following external libraries were used:
## drywetmidi
this is a library that allows for easy reading of midi files
this library can be found here:https://github.com/melanchall/drywetmidi
## acerola color generator
just out of curiousity i used acerolas color generator as a randomize option for the colors of the tracks, you can find the website here: https://acerola.gg/colors.html
## FFmpeg
while not directly in the library i use FFmpeg in the build on my computer which i can't completely upload because of github file limits. I made no changes to this library and exclusivly use it to make the videos during the render process

and just to be sure:
This software uses code of <a href=http://ffmpeg.org>FFmpeg</a> licensed under the <a href=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>LGPLv2.1</a> and its source can be downloaded <a href=link_to_your_sources>here</a>
